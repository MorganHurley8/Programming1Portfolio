### This is a compilation of various projects I have worked on throughout the year in my programming class. 
#### Jeopardy Game Project
For our final project in the 2016-17 school year my group decided to make a Jeopardy Game.

As a group, we decided to implement 9 categories of 5 questions into our trivia game.

Each member of our group created 10 questions for the categories they were assigned. After that,the group voted on which questions we would use in our game. I created the Art, Music, and Science questions. Each question is its own picture. One answers the questions in our game by clicking on seperate graphics for each possible answer. If the player answers correctly it will bring up another graphic informing them that they have selected the right answer and adds 5 to 10 points to their score, if not the program just brings up an incorrect answer graphic. Our game cycles through all the questions in a category before letting a player choose a new category.

We all contributed to the code. Each person wrote code for the parts concerning their own categories. Some parts we all wrote together.

Here is how we organized the creation of our project.

These are the graphics we created in the beginning. It ended up looking a lot different than how we envisioned it to be.

### Pig Latin Sketch
For this project I had to write a code that would take ordinary text and turn it into Pig Latin. Not only did the code have to translate the input, I also had to make it follow the grammar principles of Pig Latin

### Time Sketch
For this project I had to create a code that could calculate how much time has passed after a certain event. For example, it can calculate exactly how old a person is down to the minute.

### 99 Bottles Sketch
For this project I had to create a program that would print the entire "99 Bottles" song in as few lines of code as possible.
