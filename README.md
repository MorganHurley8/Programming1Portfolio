As a group, we decided to implement 9 categories of questions into our trivia game

Each member of our group created 10 questions for the categories they were assigned. After that,the group voted on which questions we would use in our game. I created the Art, Music, and Science questions.

You can use the [editor on GitHub]() to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MorganHurley8/Programming1Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
